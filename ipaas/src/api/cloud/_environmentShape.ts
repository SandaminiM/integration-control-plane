/**
 * The BFF environment wire shape, and the one mapper that normalizes it.
 *
 * Two domain modules need this: `environments.ts` for environment CRUD, and
 * `deploymentPipelines.ts` to project environments into promotion-chain templates.
 * It lives in its own module so neither of them has to depend on the other —
 * `environments.ts` already imports `appendEnvironmentToDefaultPipeline` from
 * `deploymentPipelines.ts`, so exporting the mapper from `environments.ts` instead
 * would close an import cycle.
 *
 * Keeping a second, hand-rolled copy of this shape is what caused pipelines to be
 * written with environment display names instead of slugs: the duplicate read `name`
 * as the slug, so every promotion ref built from it pointed at a label
 * ("Development") rather than an environment ("development"), and autoDeploy then
 * failed for every component in the project. Add fields here, not in a local
 * interface.
